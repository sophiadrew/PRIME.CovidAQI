### Little bits on data cleaning
just an FYI...

Demographic data = 3,220 observations

Covid data = 3,342 observations
- Starting from Jan 2020 to Jan 1 2022
- What is a good way to capture cases? Right now its #Cumulativecases / Population = large number

AQI data = 1,093 observations
- possibly retrieve from EPA API... BUT https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RAQSAPI/vignettes/RAQSAPIvignette.html


Combined data
 - about 40 counties that did not cross over, may have to manually 
 
# Mapping
Here are some variables:
*Cumulative Death = Cumulative deaths / Population
*Cumulative Death per Case = Cumulative deaths / Cumulative Case
*Cumulative Case = Cumulative Case / Population

##  Deaths per cases by county
```{r demo1,  fig.cap='', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("~/Documents/School/Spring 2022/PRIME.2/PRIME.CovidAQI/results/deathspercasecountymap.png")
```

##  Cumulative Case rate by county
```{r demo2,  fig.cap='', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("~/Documents/School/Spring 2022/PRIME.2/PRIME.CovidAQI/results/caseratecountymap.png")
```
##  Deaths per cases by county W/ GGPLOT
```{r demo3,  fig.cap='', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("~/Documents/School/Spring 2022/PRIME.2/PRIME.CovidAQI/results/caseratecountymap2.png")
```


##  AQI average by county
```{r demo4,  fig.cap='', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("~/Documents/School/Spring 2022/PRIME.2/PRIME.CovidAQI/results/AQIcountymap.png")
```
